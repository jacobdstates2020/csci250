    "    * The Pull-down setup connects the input pin to ground internally, forcing the pin to consistently read 0. The button is then placed in the path between the pin and the resistor to regulate the pin's state.\n",
    "    *The pull-up setup connects 3.3 V to the pin to hold it in the 1 state. The button's A pin is connected to ground and C pin to the input pin. The button here connects the pin to ground locking it in the 0 state while pressed.\n",
