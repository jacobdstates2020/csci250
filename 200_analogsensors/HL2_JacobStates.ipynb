    "\n",
    "### Potentiometer\n",
    "1. How does the output voltage change as you turn the knob of the potentiometer?\n",
    "    * As you turn the knob all the way \"up\" it reads 3.3 V and \"down\" as 0.0 V. As you turn the knob between \"up\" and \"down\" it varies the voltage linearly between 3.3 V and 0.0V\n",
    "2. What do you think would happen if you connected the output of the potentiometer to a GPIO pin? (Try it!)\n",
    "    * Then the GPIO pin would read 0 or 1 depending on if the potentiometer is set to a high enough voltage to overcome the threshhold for the pin to read 1 (>1.8).\n",
    "3. What could happen if you connected 3.3V and GND to an outer and the middle pins? (Don't try it!)\n",
    "    * If the knob is turned all the way up or down then it could short the potentiometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Photoresistor\n",
    "1. How must the photoresistor be wired in order to use it? (Hint: this configuration has a name!)\n",
    "    * In series with a 10 kohm resistor in a circuit called a voltage divider.\n",
    "2. How does the resistance change with light intensity?\n",
    "    * The resistance of the circuit increases with decreasing light intensity.\n",
    "3. What range of resistances do you measure from the photoresistor?\n",
    "    * Between 1-10 kohm "
