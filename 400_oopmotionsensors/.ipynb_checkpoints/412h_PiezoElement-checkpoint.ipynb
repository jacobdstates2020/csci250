    "    \n",
    "* **The ADC always returns 0**.\n",
    "    * You're probably having an issue communicating with the ADC, which would most likely come from a wiring problem. Double check your wiring with ADC notebook to make sure the connections are correct. Also double check your code for any bugs, and that you're using the same channel that the piezo element is connected to.\n",
    "    * Make sure you have decent electrical connections from the piezo element. Its wires are very thin and don't stay well connected in the breadboards, so it can be useful to insert something else into the same breadboard hole to ensure there's a connection, such as a resistor leg or jumper wire.\n",
    "    * Make sure your pull-down resistor is 1M Ohm. Smaller resistors like 330 Ohms will pull-down much more dramatically, meaning you won't be able to make good measurements.\n",
    "    * Ensure that the wires haven't broken off the piezo element. \n",

    "* **I get funky numbers from the ADC test the piezo element**.\n",
    "    * As stated in the wiring section, the voltage across the piezo element doesn't always rest at 0V, which can give you weird values. Be sure to include the 1M Ohm pull-down resistor if you're having problems with this.\n",
    "    * It's possible that the measurement pin of the ADC is left floating because it's not connected to anything; simply moving your hand near the ADC can cause the values to change! Make sure your piezo element is connected to one of the channel pins of the ADC, and make sure your code is getting data from the same channel.\n",
    "    * If the above doesn't help, try swapping your piezo element with a neighbor's. If the new one works, yours is likely broken.\n",
    "    * If your neighbor's piezo element still gives you funky values, try your neighbor's ADC. If the new one works, yours is likely broken."
