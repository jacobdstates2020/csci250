In order to use this protocol, we need to enable the I<sup>2</sup>C interface on the RPi: go to the RPi Configuration from Preferences, then on the Interfaces tab for I<sup>2</sup>C click enable, then OK (you should have already done this from setup day).\n",

Data from all devices are then sent over the data wire, denoted SDA for **serial data**. The data sent across this wire are synced up with the clock, where a high voltage on the data line indicates a 1 bit, and a low voltage indicates a 0 bit. \n",

    "Every subordinate device has an address that is assigned when the chip is manufactured; the master device is informed of the addresses by the programmer. The first data sent out by the master is the address of the device; all of the subordinate devices read the address to see if the master is communicating with them. The master can then send data to the appropriate subordinate device, and all other devices ignore these data. Once the master stops sending data, the subordinate device can send its own data to the master through the SDA wire. "

On page 21 of the datasheet, the first sentence in the second paragraph states the address of the accelerometer as being  `0b001100` or `0b001101`. The reason it gives 2 options is because you could have 2 sensors on the same I<sup>2</sup>C bus that have the same address. They would both respond at the same time causing communication issues, so you can change the address to prevent problems. We are only using 1 sensor, so we don't have to worry about it; the default address will be `0b001101` because the last bit defaults to high. \n",

Page 29 of the datasheet contains information about the first control register, which allows us to put the sensor into normal mode with a specified data rate configuration. Table 26 indicates that setting the first bits to 0111 corresponds to normal mode with 400kHz data rate. The next bit in the register enables us to select normal mode (set the bit to 0).

If you look at the registers for the $x$ axis (`0x28` and `0x29`), the first register contains the least significant 8 bits, and the second contains the most significant 8 bits.

If it's 1, then we need to force the number to be a negative value. Because the number is in 2's complement format, we can do this simply by subtracting 2<sup>12</sup> (or 4096) from the number. To understand why this works, think about the edge cases: \n",

Since we are using the 2g range, that gave us a resolution of 1g/1024, so if we simply divide each number by 1024 we will get the acceleration in g's. If you instead want m/s$^2$, you can then just multiply by $9.81 m/s^2$. Then we're done! If you run the code in the following cell, you should have roughly $0$ in the $x$ and $y$ directions and $9.81 m/s^2$ in the $z$ direction."
