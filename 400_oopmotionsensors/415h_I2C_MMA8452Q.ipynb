In order to use this protocol, we need to enable the I<sup>2</sup>C interface on the RPi: go to the RPi Configuration from Preferences, then on the Interfaces tab for I<sup>2</sup>C click enable, then OK (you should have already done this from setup day).\n",

The master can then send data to the appropriate subordinate device, and all other devices ignore these data. Once the master stops sending data, the subordinate device can send its own data to the master through the SDA wire. "

On page 16 of the datasheet, the first sentence in the third paragraph states the address of the accelerometer as being either `0b0011100` or `0b0011101`. The reason it gives 2 options is because you could have 2 sensors on the same I<sup>2</sup>C bus that have the same address. They would both respond at the same time causing communication issues, so you can change the address to prevent problems. We are only using 1 sensor, so we don't have to worry about it; the default address will be `0b0011101` because the last bit defaults to high. \n",

On page 18 of the datasheet, Table 11 includes a list of  registers that one can play with, followed by a description of their usage. Each provides different benefits, so feel free to explore and experiment with them once you're comfortable using the accelerometer.

As explained in Note 2 of Table 11, we can't read acceleration data in standby mode, so we need to go to the **active mode**. Page 37 of the datasheet contains information about the first control register, which allows us to put the sensor into active mode. You can see in the bit description figure that bit 0 (the last bit) is the active bit. Table 53 describes what each bit does and their default states (0 for each bit); you can see that setting the active bit to 0 sets the standby mode, and 1 sets the active mode. Obviously we want to set the active mode, so we'll need to set this bit to 1. We don't care about the rest of the options available here, and they default to 0 anyway, so we can to send the byte `0b00000001` or just 1. \n",

The first parameter is the address of the device, the second is the register that we want to write to, and data is what we want to write. As you can see in the datasheet, the hexadecimal value of the first control register is `0x2A`.

Page 20 of the datasheet describes how the registers store the acceleration data: each axis has 12 bits of resolution, which are each stored in 2 registers. Because each register is 8 bits in size (1 byte), that leaves 4 extra unused bits that are always 0. If you look at the registers for the $x$ axis (`0x01` and `0x02`), the first register contains the first 8 bits, and the second contains the last 4 bits followed by 4 zeros.

The method returns an array of bytes from each register, so that needs to be stored somewhere.

The second paragraph states that the resolution of each data register depends on the measurement range (the datasheet calls it full scale), which can be set to $\\pm$2g (1g/1024), $\\pm$4g (1g/512), or $\\pm$8g (1g/256).\n",
