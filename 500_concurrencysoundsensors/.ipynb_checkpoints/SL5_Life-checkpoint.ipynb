    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to simulate the concept of parallel worlds based on the famous [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). We will simulate a scenario of two parallel universes which function based on the rules of the game, but which exchange information (in one direction) at various times. This scenario will give us an opportunity to use Python concurrent execution, i.e. use separate threads to simulate \"life\" in each universe, and use queues to exchange information between the universes."

    "# Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the basic logic of the Game of Life. In this step, you will work with a single universe and you do not need to use concurrency (we will later use threading to simulate the game in multiple universes). Use vectorization whenever possible to achieve the fastest implementation possible.\n",
    "    * simulate the transformation of the game field from one generation to another\n",
    "    * generate an entire cube representing the field at multiple generations (e.g. 100).\n",
    "    * plot an animation of the simulation (see below).\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Implement separate functions corresponding to a producer and a consumer that share information using a queue. The logic is the following:\n",
    "    * The **producer** inserts a specific shape at random locations in its field\n",
    "        * for simplicity, the producer uses only the \"glider\" shape (see below)\n",
    "        * add the glider to the field only at 10% of the time steps selected randomly\n",
    "        \n",
    "    and puts into a queue at every generation its index and a flag\n",
    "        * the boolean flag specifies if at least 25 cells are alive in its field at that time\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The **consumer** receives the information from the queue and\n",
    "        * inserts a glider into the field at a random position every time the received flag is `True`.\n",
    "        * Once a glider is inserted, the consumer does not insert another one for at least 5 generations\n",
    "    \n",
    "    and advances using the GoL logic, like the producer.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Thus, the producer and the consumer fields evolve by the same rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "They also exchange information (from the producer to the consumer) at specific times according to the rules specified before (i.e. the flag is `True` at all generations when the producer field has 25 live cells).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Launch the producer and the consumer in separate threads\n",
    "    * use a queue to pass information from one thread to another\n",
    "    * start both threads at the same time (i.e. in very close succession)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Plot side-by-side an animation of the two fields, thus visualizing the moments when information is exchanged  between the two universes (from the producer to the consumer)."
