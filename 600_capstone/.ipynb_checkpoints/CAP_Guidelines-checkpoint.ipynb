This will give you an opportunity to apply concepts and techniques learned in class to a project of your choice. We are setting-up a few rules in order to facilitate evaluation consistency, but otherwise we would like to see your ideas at work. We hope that you will turn this project into something practical and of interest to you, rather than just something you do for course credit."
